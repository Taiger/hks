I am working on a new base theme for Drupal 8!
==
Frozen development on this project to focus on a new version using a different css-framework. HTML Kickstart can work for some projects so I will keep it. Also, a small site I built is dependent upon it.

I am reusing the Drupal parts of the this theme to implement a different CSS Framework called Uikit.
Advantages of Uikit over Html Kickstart are:
CSS preprocessor integration using LESS.
Better structure and organization.
All classes and they are name-spaced which makes integrating with Drupal easier.

-----------------
HTML Kickstart For Drupal is an ultra-lean theme that utilizes the CSS and JS helper framework from Lime99. It is a responsive layout system with optional 12-grid columns. It utilizes vector Font Awesome Icons!

In the spirit of Mothership and modern standards a lot of the Drupal frontend has been cleaned up in this theme. Though it is not as comprehensive as Mothership this theme could cause layout issues. This is mitigated by the responsive layout. So far I have found that the layouts to be remarkably robust considering how little CSS is behind it.

This is intended to be used as a base theme. However, feel free to fork it and shape to your liking!

I borrowed from Mothership, Zen and Tao themes. With almost all default CSS removed it has a whole new look for theme as well. I wasn't intending it to be for an admin theme as well, but so far it works great.
